# cornell-club-board
This is a project currently being developed by Dylan Vig (drv36) and Matt Cowan (mwc97). This project aims to create a web application where student organizations can post club applications and students can post personal projects, and it serves as a centralized job board for students when applying to these clubs/projects.
